# Hi, i'm Diego Fernando <s>🤝</s>🤜🤛

I currently have a bachelor's degree in Information Systems at the Federal University of Piauí (UFPI) and currently work with software development (Web fullstack and desktop).

I had experiences with the following technologies: **Java** (Spring Boot, Play Framework), **Python** (Django, Django Rest Framework), **Scala** (Play Framework, Lagom) and **JavaScript**. Currently, I work as an Information Iechnology Analyst developing solutions based on **microservices**. (Updated on 20/09/2020).
